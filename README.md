mosh-kill-other
===============

This will kill other mosh-server processes.

This may not be the best in all cases, but when I am using mosh from one source only -- where I sometimes accidentally close the mosh client or otherwise lose the process -- my mosh-server processes pile up.
I wanted a quick script to kill the other ones.

This script may and will cause you to lose work, and may punch your puppy in the face. If it breaks, you get to keep the pieces.
